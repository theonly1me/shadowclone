# Deterministic profiles and reversible installs

This is the legacy profile compiler design. [Repository harnesses](022-repository-harness.md) reduced startup context, and [skills delivery](023-skills-as-delivery.md) replaced profile injection for active skill environments.

## Problem

Different callers rendered profiles differently. Some dropped conditions and provenance, counted nested headings as separate rules, or delivered conflicting choices. Installed artifacts also lacked a reliable removal record.

## Decision

Use one `compileProfile` operation for profile delivery, returning Markdown, applied-rule counts and keys, and explicit omission reasons. Read only global files, the matching remote-owner files, and the exact repository file.

Order user-written, declared, and imported guidance ahead of mined guidance. Resolve known preference-axis conflicts deterministically. Lifecycle states decide eligibility; the compiler does not reinterpret evidence or match natural-language conditions against task keywords. Render those conditions for the agent to follow.

Admit whole blocks under a 16,384-byte UTF-8 limit, including labels and separators. Continue considering smaller blocks after an oversized block is omitted. Never slice a rule, code fence, or multibyte character. Report lifecycle, axis-conflict, and budget omissions.

Pair local metadata with redacted visible text from the same bounded snapshot. Fingerprints and lifecycle come from the original text; every model-facing title, body, and condition comes from the redacted side. Redaction must not make a generated rule appear manually edited.

## Installation ownership

Record installed paths and installer-added Git exclude entries in a local manifest. Reinstallation retains ownership records. Uninstall removes only supported artifacts and owned entries, preserving unrelated files. `forget --all` processes recorded installations before deleting local state.

Automatic delegation is opt-in through `--auto-delegate`. Its workflow carries a structured task brief with context, constraints, verification, and expected output. Default installation must not silently enable delegation.

## Verification

Check deterministic output, authority ordering, scope, whole-block budgets, redaction, and accurate applied-rule counts. Exercise install, reinstall, uninstall, edited artifacts, missing repositories, and unrelated exclude entries. Installations predating the manifest require bounded compatibility handling; they cannot be discovered by scanning arbitrary repositories.
