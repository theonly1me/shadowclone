# Design history

These records explain decisions and tradeoffs. Later records can replace earlier designs; use the [architecture](../architecture/README.md) and [user guide](../../README.md#get-started) for current behavior.

The main delivery changes were transcript learning, native main-agent context, and then portable skills. Designs 006 through 019 include profile-era decisions that remain relevant to migration. Designs 022 through 024 describe repository setup and the skills environment, and design 027 describes the preference study.

Start a new decision with the [template](template.md), or extend the relevant record. Include only sections needed to understand and verify the change. Keep implementation-session logs out of these pages.
